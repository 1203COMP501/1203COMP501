<h1>Adolescent technology addition</h1>


</ul><h5><p>Describe your chosen technology/topic:</p></h5>
<p>Adolescents who spent more time on technology or social media, and less time on person to person interaction and exercise had lower psychological wellbeing</p>
  <h5><p>Why is it significant and/or has important implications for society:<p></h5>
    <p>Adolescents who spent majority of their time on devices are more likely to report mental health issues, this results in a generation of adolescents developing mental problems, which could potentially cripple society.</p>

<!-- <p><em>When deciding on your chosen technology/topic, it is best not to choose something too broad, but limit the focus e.g. consider the level of social analysis from the figure below.</p></em>
<p><em>E.g. What is the level of analysis - culture or organization; Responsibility - individual or pro fessional; Ethical issue - power or equity; Technology - medical, nuclear, mobile?</p></em>
