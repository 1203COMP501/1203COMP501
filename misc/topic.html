<h1>Adolescent technology addition</h1>

<!-- <h5><p>Describe your chosen technology/topic:</p></h5> -->
<p class="bold">What is addiction:</p>
<p>Addiction is exhibiting a compulsive, chronic, physiological or psychological need for a  substance, behavior, or activity despite substantial harm and other negative consequences.</p>

<p>Internet addiction can be defined as overuse of the Internet leading to impairment of an individualâ€™s psychological state (both mental and emotional), as well as their scholastic or occupational and social interactions (Beard & Wolf, 2001)</p>

<h5><p>Why is it significant and/or has important implications for society:<p></h5>
<p>Technology is addicting to teenagers and causes negative impacts to their daily lives and activities. It is starting to seem like technology causes more harm than good in adolescents. Adolescents who spent majority of their time on devices are more likely to report mental health issues, this results in a generation of adolescents developing mental problems, which could potentially cripple society.</p>
<p>The Internet has provide adolescents a place where they can question and explore more about their own sense of self but at the same time bring about the negative impacts of cyberbulling and other health issues.</p>
<p>We believe everyone has a role to play in helping adolescents with technology addiction.</p>

<h5><p>Why has such a phenomenon risen?:<p></h5>
<p>Internet provides them (adolescents) with many opportunities to explore their identity, find support and information about developmentally sensitive issues, and develop close and meaningful relationships. However, Concerns have been voiced that adolescents develop shallow relationships with online strangers or may become victims of online solicitation and cyberbullying. (Patti M. Valkenburg, Jochen Peter, 2010)</p>
<p> Internet provides them with many opportunities to explore their identity, find support and information about developmentally sensitive issues, and develop close and meaningful relationships. (Patti M. Valkenburg, Jochen Peter, 2010)</p>
<p>The easy accessibility of persons, for example on social network sites, allows adolescents to interact with peers whom they may not have seen for a long time or whom they cannot meet easily in their lives. Similarly, adolescents can conveniently spread information about themselves among a wide variety of people. (Patti M. Valkenburg, Jochen Peter, 2010)</p>

<p>These studies show that technology may provide a safe haven for adolescents due to its easy accessibility and its vast amount of opportunites for adolescents to understand themselves. However, it also brings risk that affect their physical and psychological health.</p>
