<p class="bold">What is addiction:</p>
<p>Addiction is exhibiting a compulsive, chronic, physiological or psychological need for a  substance, behavior, or activity despite substantial harm and other negative consequences.</p>

<h5><p>Why is it significant and/or has important implications for society:<p></h5>
<p>Technology is addicting to teenagers and causes negative impacts to their daily lives and activities. It is starting to seem like technology causes more harm than good in adolescents. Adolescents who spent majority of their time on devices are more likely to report mental health issues, this results in a generation of adolescents developing mental problems, which could potentially cripple society.</p>
