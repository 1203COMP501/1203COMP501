    <h1>Project Process Support</h1>
    <p>
      Your team project has several stages, and the assignment process is
      supported by the linked resources in this mock-up site.
    </p>

    <p>
      This mock-up site is intended to support your team project so you can take
      this as a set of files and as a starting point and adapt it to your
      preference.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is built on a W3C site tutorial so does not claim to be flash, but now
      has an image, not well presented, but at least the site uses HTML and has
      been styled with CSS &hellip;
    </p>
    <p>
      And it has links, which you can take as a start for your site structure.
      The <em>Process Support </em>Links provides guidance which will be needed
      for presenting your final project.
