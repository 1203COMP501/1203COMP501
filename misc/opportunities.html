<h1>Opportunities to Improve</h1>

	<!-- How adolescents technology addicition could be improved.  -->
	<p>
		Social media makes their experiences more game-like using methods such as Facebook likes and Snapchat streaks (Baecker, Ronald M, 2019, 351). These game-like apps keep them coming back day after day, developing a chronic and compulsive need to gain more likes, or get a higher streak. Adolescents aim to gain more of these virtual achievements as they use technology, unaware that they are developing an addiction.
	</p>
	<p> Thus, the only people who could make a proper impact against technology addiciton in adolescents are those who cause and perpetuate the problem; Companies should be the ones to help adolescents with their addiction instead of the opposite. Companies could be able to use e-mails or notifications as a way to remind adolescents to moderate their time while using technology. For example; game daily check-ins, automatic timers after a set amount of time, removal of features such as likes and streaks.
