<h1>Opportunities to Improve</h1>

<!-- How adolescents technology addicition could be improved.  -->

<p>The Internet provides them (adolescents) with many opportunities to explore their identity, find support and information about developmentally sensitive issues, and develop close and meaningful relationships. (Patti M. Valkenburg, Jochen Peter, 2010) However, not just adolescents, companies may abuse these rights when using these technologies to connect with people. <mark>Online anonymity</mark> may also stimulate impulsive reactions, which may result in disinhibited, aggressive, and insulting comments, as well as in cyberbullying and online harassment of peers. (Patti M. Valkenburg, Jochen Peter, 2010)</p>
<p>Clinicians, educators, and policymakers agree that treatment strategies for tackling the Internet addiction problem need to be accompanied by prevention strategies that address risk factors before addiction evolves into a more serious form (Kwon, 2011; Yu & Shek, 2013).</p>
	
	<p>
		Social media makes their experiences more <mark>game-like</mark> using methods such as Facebook likes and Snapchat streaks (Baecker, Ronald M, 2019, 351). These game-like apps keep them coming back day after day, developing a chronic and compulsive need to gain more likes, or get a higher streak. Adolescents aim to gain more of these virtual achievements as they use technology, unaware that they are developing an addiction.
	</p>
	<p> Thus, the only people who could make a proper impact against technology addiciton in adolescents are those who cause and perpetuate the problem; Companies should be the ones to help adolescents with their addiction instead of the opposite. Companies could be able to use e-mails or notifications as a way to remind adolescents to moderate their time while using technology. For example; game daily check-ins, automatic timers after a set amount of time, removal of features such as likes and streaks.
		</p>

	<p>Companies should also increase the <mark>eligibility criteria</mark> of creating accounts on their softwares. Nowadays, g-mails or social media accounts can be created without vertification of any sort and this allows hackers and online buillies to use fake accounts to act. There should be an extra criteria that requires users to innput their phone numbers or ID for vertification and yearly check-ups should be implemented. </p>

	<p>As adolescents are still in a school environment, the people around them have the assets to help relieve them from their technology addiction.
	Prevention programs should be implemented in the school environment, especially in elementary school settings that are often on the front line of the identiﬁcation of potentially life-threatening behaviors (Jang & Ji, 2012; Lan & Lee, 2013). Schools should provide more lectures in technology addiction and also try connecting with students in both <mark>physical and virtual worlds</mark>. Teachers should put effort in the prevention of technology addiction and also shift students' focus from technology by helping them develop <mark>hobbies</mark> outside of the online world.</p>

	<p>Parents are also a key factor to adolescents development and their actions could have significant impacts on their lives. Some researchers also point out the presence of certain factors or parenting styles that promote the development of Internet addiction and they stress the need to work not only with vulnerable individuals but also with their loved ones, especially their parents. The improvement of parent–child communication, the amount of time spent with their children, understanding their child’s needs, and the improvement of parental mental health. (Vondráčková P, Gabrhelík R, 2016)These are some of what that could be improved that could help adolescents stay away from technology addiction.</p>
