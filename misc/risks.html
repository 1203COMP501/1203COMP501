<h1>Risks of Adolescent Technology Addiction</h1>

<!-- </ul><h4><p>Describe the risks posed by your chosen technology/topic:<p></h4> -->
<p>
  Technology addiction is defined as “a user's psychological state of maladaptive dependency on IT use that is manifested through the obsessive-compulsive pattern of IT-seeking and IT-use behaviours that take place at the expense of other important activities” (Xu, Turel, & Yuan, 2012, p. 321), when an adolescent starts to prioritise technology over social interaction this risks social isolation, and prolonged dependence on the technology results in lower psychological well-being. (Baecker, Ronald M., 2019, 351).

<p>
  Technology enables teenagers to be manipulated online through scams, online dating, and cyber bullying. Concerns have been raised that adolescents develop shallow relationships with online strangers or may become victims of online solicitation and cyber bullying. (Patti M. Valkenburg, Jochen Peter, 2011). Adolescent suicide rates are increasingly high due to social media and the people who harras, bully, and torment adolescents online, the people causing these suicides are both adults and adolescents.
</p>
<p>
  The anonymity of the internet allows adolescents to use technology for bullying and hate-speech, forgoing any sort of consequences or punishment for their actions. Anonymity affects the controllability of self-presentation and self-disclosure. For a long time, it has been assumed that anonymity simulates deindividuation effects, defined as the loss of one's sense of individuality and personal responsibility (Patti M. Valkenburg, Jochen Peter, 2011).
