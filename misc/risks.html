<h1>Risks of Adolescent Technology Addiction</h1>

<!-- </ul><h4><p>Describe the risks posed by your chosen technology/topic:<p></h4> -->
<p>
  Technology addiction is defined as “a user's psychological state of maladaptive dependency on IT use that is manifested through the obsessive-compulsive pattern of IT-seeking and IT-use behaviours that take place at the expense of other important activities” (Xu, Turel, & Yuan, 2012, p. 321), when an adolescent starts to prioritise technology over social interaction this risks social isolation, and prolonged dependence on the technology results in lower psychological well-being. (Baecker, Ronald M., 2019, 351).
</p>
<p>
  Technology enables teenagers to be manipulated online through scams, online dating, and cyber bullying. Concerns have been raised that adolescents develop shallow relationships with online strangers or may become victims of online solicitation and cyber bullying. (Patti M. Valkenburg, Jochen Peter, 2011). Adolescent suicide rates are increasingly high due to social media and the people who harras, bully, and torment adolescents online, the people causing these suicides are both adults and adolescents.
</p>
<p>
  The anonymity of the internet allows adolescents to use technology for bullying and hate-speech, forgoing any sort of consequences or punishment for their actions. Anonymity affects the controllability of self-presentation and self-disclosure. For a long time, it has been assumed that anonymity simulates deindividuation effects, defined as the loss of one's sense of individuality and personal responsibility (Patti M. Valkenburg, Jochen Peter, 2011).
</p>

<p>About one in three adolescents prefer online communication over face-to-face communication to talk about intimate topics, such as love, sex, and things they are ashamed about. The <mark>enhanced controllability</mark> of self-presentation and self-disclosure provides them with the opportunity to overcome the social hindrances that they typically encounter in offline communication settings. Online anonymity may lead to less concern about their physical appearance (e.g., pimples, blushes), which may facilitate adolescents' online self-disclosure and self-presentation, and, as a result, their opportunities for approval and social acceptance. The level of <mark>editability</mark> is higher than that in face-to-face communication, in which communication can only be adjusted afterward rather than before it is transmitted. The Internet gives adolescents more opportunities than ever to interact with people from different backgrounds. As a result, adolescents can <mark>validate their identities</mark> against a vastly expanded social sounding board, which in turn may stimulate their self-concept clarity. (Patti M. Valkenburg, Jochen Peter, 2010)</p>
<p>Disclosing their own personal secrets may help them voice out their feelings and can help them gain an in-depth understanding of their own self. But through this, they will be vulnerable and may become  victims of online solicitation and bullying.</p>
<p>Adolescents have always turned to the media for information related to identity, intimacy, and sexuality. However, never before did they have such abundant opportunities to find, create, and distribute identity-, intimacy-, and sex-related information. Because of the possibility of anonymous communication on the Internet, adolescents can address sensitive sexual issues more easily than in face-to-face communication. Adolescents who are most at risk for unwanted sexual solicitation are boys who are gay or those who are uncertain about their sexual orientation. (Patti M. Valkenburg, Jochen Peter, 2010)</p>
<p>Online anonymity may also stimulate impulsive reactions, which may result in disinhibited, aggressive, and insulting comments, as well as in <mark>cyberbullying and online harassment</mark> of peers. Correlational studies among teenagers in the United States have shown that being the victim of cyberbullying is associated with many psychosocial attributes, such as increased social anxiety, psychological distress, and symptoms of depression. (Patti M. Valkenburg, Jochen Peter, 2010)</p>
<p>Adolescents become <mark>vulnerable</mark> when they think they have connected with someone who experiences the same/similar encounters and would disclose a lot of details. But they may never know who those people are behind the screens and their intentions with such information. For example, They could be a bully from school or a person trying to get personal information from teens to manipulate them. The anonymity online may decieve adolescents in falling into traps of predators and bullies.</p>
