<h1>Technology Choices</h1>


<!-- <h4><p>The page or area describing the choices available to us through or by your chosen technology/topic.<p></h4> -->
	<p>
		It has become difficult to aid adolescents with overcoming their technology addiction as they are either <mark>in denial or are unaware</mark> of their own situation. Society has the choice to aid them; to denormalise the use of technology for hours each day, to steer adolescents away from technology and more to social interaction face-to-face. Because technology has both positive and negative impacts on adolescents its difficult to decide what should be done, its not clear what choices should be made, hence why technology addiction in adolescents has been able to grow into the problem it is today.
	</p>
	<p>
		“The general effects of technology on adolescents are on the negative end of the spectrum but very small, effects differ depending on the type of use” (Dienlin, T., & Johannes, N. (2020), the choice on how to deal with technology addiction in adolescents is difficult because technology use is so diverse, it can be used to learn or to harm, and to communicate or to bully, this makes the choices even more difficult as there be both pros and cons from every outcome; for example, technology could be removed entirely, but this would result in adolescents having no means to research or explore the internet and it’s near infinite plethora of knowledge. Vice versa, allowing unlimited access would result in adolescents delving into the deepest and darkest recesses of the internet where some things have been banned for good reasons.
	</p>
	<p>
		The impact of technology on adolescents is as diverse as technology itself, multiple studies reporting a wide range of positive, neutral, or negative relations between specific measures of digital technology use and well-being (Dienlin, T., & Johannes, N. (2020).  “It is important not to patronize adolescents—effects are comparable and adolescents not powerless”  (Dienlin, T., & Johannes, N. (2020) the most effective and least consequential choice is to <mark>increase awareness</mark> of technology addiction in adolescents but ultimately allow them to make the decisions to help themselves, allow them to make the choices, but supply them with the correct information required to make an informed decision.
	</p>
	<p>It will be important to design future research that will help us determine which teens will benefit from online communication, and which may be harmed. Only if we understand individual differences in the use and effects of online communication will we be able to design interventions that target different (subgroups of) adolescents. •	An important challenge both for future Internet researchers, health care professionals, and parents is to understand how to enhance the opportunities of online communication while managing its risks.  (Patti M. Valkenburg, Jochen Peter, 2010)
	For example, the Chinese government has implemented tighter control mechanisms on Internet cafés and an anti-addiction or fatigue system. The regulations, for example, state that no Internet café is allowed within 200 meters of an elementary or middle school or that the business hours of Internet cafés must be limited to between 8 a.m. and midnight (Guosong, 2010).</p>

		<p>The mere provision of information about the negative consequences of risk behavior is <mark>ineffective</mark> and it needs to be complemented by interactive interventions aimed at changing attitudes and the development of selected skills for life (Soole, Mazerolle, & Rombouts, 2008) and the effective prevention interventions should be complex and focused on Internet addiction and other forms of risk behavior (Gong et al., 2009) and should be a combination of interventions targeting vulnerable people with an Internet addiction, their parents and other loved ones, and the community, school, or work environment (Frangos & Sotiropoulos, 2010). </p>

	<p>Society should not just be implementing choices that barely scratches the surface of the bigger problem. There is a need for the government to <mark>provide resources and help</mark> for the people around the adolescents who are addicted to technology instead of just feeding them information that would not give them a push in perception of their current situation.</p>
