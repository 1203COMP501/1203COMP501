<h1>Technology Choices</h1>


<!-- <h4><p>The page or area describing the choices available to us through or by your chosen technology/topic.<p></h4> -->
	<p>
		It has become difficult to aid adolescents with overcoming their technology addiction as they are either in denial or are unaware of their own situation. Society has the choice to aid them; to denormalise the use of technology for hours each day, to steer adolescents away from technology and more to social interaction face-to-face. Because technology has both positive and negative impacts on adolescents its difficult to decide what should be done, its not clear what choices should be made, hence why technology addiction in adolescents has been able to grow into the problem it is today.
	</p>
	<p>
		“The general effects of technology on adolescents are on the negative end of the spectrum but very small, effects differ depending on the type of use” (Dienlin, T., & Johannes, N. (2020), the choice on how to deal with technology addiction in adolescents is difficult because technology use is so diverse, it can be used to learn or to harm, and to communicate or to bully, this makes the choices even more difficult as there be both pros and cons from every outcome; for example, technology could be removed entirely, but this would result in adolescents having no means to research or explore the internet and it’s near infinite plethora of knowledge. Vice versa, allowing unlimited access would result in adolescents delving into the deepest and darkest recesses of the internet where some things have been banned for good reasons.

	<p>
		The impact of technology on adolescents is as diverse as technology itself, multiple studies reporting a wide range of positive, neutral, or negative relations between specific measures of digital technology use and well-being (Dienlin, T., & Johannes, N. (2020).  “It is important not to patronize adolescents—effects are comparable and adolescents not powerless”  (Dienlin, T., & Johannes, N. (2020) the most effective and least consequential choice is to increase awareness of technology addiction in adolescents but ultimately allow them to make the decisions to help themselves, allow them to make the choices, but supply them with the correct information required to make an informed decision.
